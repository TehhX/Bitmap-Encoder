# Bitmap-Encoder
This repo is for me to learn how bitmap files work, mainly how to read and write them.

## Basic Bitmap Output
This is the simplest and stupidest way to write a bitmap file. The image itself was taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format)

## Intermediate Bitmap Output
This takes advantage of general hex writing with functions to write the same image, but is still for only one specific image.

## Advanced Bitmap Output
This generates patterns, and uses OOP to write their contents automatically. This is my best attempt at writing .bmp.
